```

A thin wrapper over [@ipld/car](https://github.com/ipld/js-car) and [unix-fs-exporter](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-unixfs-exporter). It fetches the data by from the IPFS gateway api as a .car file, extacts the cids and blocks, verifying them as it goes, and writes the reassembled data to disk.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This tool will become useful once [go-ipfs v0.9.0 lands](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/8058)**, and is deployed to the ipfs.io and dweb.link gateway. Until then it can only fetch car files from your local IPFS API, or a remote one that you have authenticated access to. In go-ipfs v0.9.0, the `/api/v0/dag/export` endpoint will become part of the public gateway api, at which point you can use this tool to fetch and locally verify content by cid from a gateway over http, which is new ‚ú® 

Before now folks just did an http get, and optimistically tried to re-add the response to a local ipfs node, which is error prone; if any non-default flags were used when adding the content, then the CID you get when adding locally would not match unless you knew ahead of time to use the same flags. By using car files, the CIDs for the blocks travel with the data, so `ipfs-get` is able to verify them, regardless of how the DAG was created (_well, it only supports sha256 verification currently, for dag-pb and dag-cbor, but that covers the vast majority of existing DAGs._)

## Usage

Install `ipfs-get` globally with `npm i -g ipfs-get` or run it via npx `npx ipfs-get <cid>`

```sh
# fetch and verify a file by cid from you local gateway
ipfs-get bafkreigh2akiscaildcqabsyg3dfr6chu3fgpregiymsck7e7aqa4s52zy

# fetch and verify a file by cid from ipfs.io (wait till go-ipfs v0.9.0 is released)
ipfs-get bafkreigh2akiscaildcqabsyg3dfr6chu3fgpregiymsck7e7aqa4s52zy --gateway https://ipfs.io

# fetch and verify a file by cid and pick the output filename
ipfs-get bafkreigh2akiscaildcqabsyg3dfr6chu3fgpregiymsck7e7aqa4s52zy --output room-guardian.jpg

```

## How

- Fetch a .car file for the root CID from `/api/v0/dag/export`. This could fail if the full dag is unavailable. it's ok.
- Index the cid and block postions in the car file
- Start at the root as defined by the car file header
- Verify each block by hashing the block as you pull it from the car, and compare the hash with the CID. Fail if not matched.
- Assemble the blocks into the files and write it to disk.
